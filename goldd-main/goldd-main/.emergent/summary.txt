The user provided a zip file for a full-stack cleaning service application and requested a preview. The initial phase involved setting up the environment: unzipping the project, moving files to the  directory, installing dependencies (, ), and configuring the application. This required obtaining SMTP credentials (email and an app-specific password) from the user to enable email notifications for bookings.

The project evolved through a series of iterative feature requests. Key additions include:
1.  **Professional Email Templates:** Refactoring the plain text emails into professional HTML templates.
2.  **Automated Email Campaigns:** Implementing a weekly email campaign system using  to send promotional emails to registered users every Monday and Friday.
3.  **Promo Code System:** Adding functionality for promo codes, including a new field in the booking form, a backend validation endpoint, and updating the booking model.
4.  **Admin Dashboard & Customer Portal:** Enhancing the admin dashboard with an analytics tab and creating a new customer portal for users to view their booking history.
5.  **Security Enhancements:** Implementing security measures like rate-limiting, input sanitization, security headers (using a new  module), and moving the hardcoded admin password to environment variables.
6.  **UI/Branding Updates:** Responding to multiple user requests to refine services, update branding from Golden Touch Cleaning to Home and Car Wash, add animations, and implement a more professional color scheme.

The last task was to provide the user's email app password and create a checklist of fixes required for a GitHub deployment. The password was retrieved, and the checklist creation was initiated.

The user's primary language is English. The next agent must respond in English.

<product_requirements>
The initial requirement was to deploy and preview a pre-existing full-stack application for a cleaning service named Golden Touch Cleaning Services. The application allows customers to book cleaning services and administrators to manage these bookings.

Over the course of development, the requirements expanded significantly based on user requests:
- **Email Functionality:** Implement and refine email notifications for booking confirmations for both the customer and the business, using professional HTML templates.
- **Marketing Automation:** Create an automated email campaign system to send promotional content to all users on a fixed schedule (Mondays and Fridays).
- **Promotions & Discounts:** Introduce a promo code system to offer discounts on services. This included applying a 30% discount to all services and creating specific promo codes like 'GOLDY'.
- **Admin & Customer Features:** Enhance the admin dashboard with analytics (revenue, booking trends) and a multi-status tracking system ('pending', 'in-progress', 'done'). A customer-facing portal was also built for users to look up their booking history.
- **Security & Deployment Readiness:** Harden the application against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF) and prepare the application for deployment by removing hardcoded secrets and URLs.
- **Branding & UI/UX:** Iteratively update the site's branding, text, service offerings, color palette, and add CSS animations to create a more professional and premium user experience. The final branding is Home and Car Wash.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Full-Stack Application:** React frontend, FastAPI backend, MongoDB database.
- **Backend Technologies:** FastAPI, Pydantic for data validation,  for asynchronous MongoDB access.
- **Email & Scheduling:**  for sending emails via Gmail's SMTP server,  for running scheduled tasks (email campaigns).
- **Frontend Technologies:** React, TailwindCSS for styling,  for API calls.
- **Environment Management:** Use of  files for storing sensitive credentials (DB connection, API keys, SMTP password) and configuration.
- **Security:** JWT for admin authentication, middleware for security headers, rate limiting, and input validation.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The project is a standard full-stack monorepo with separate  and  directories.



- ****:
  - **Importance**: The main FastAPI application file. It defines all API endpoints, application startup logic, CORS middleware, and database connection.
  - **Changes**: Heavily modified to include new endpoints for promo code validation (), manual campaign triggers, and a secure admin login (). The  was integrated here to run email campaigns. Security middleware from  was added. Booking creation logic was updated to handle promo codes and security validation.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: A new module created to handle the logic for sending scheduled promotional emails.
  - **Changes**: Created from scratch. It contains functions to fetch all unique customer emails from the database and send them pre-defined HTML email templates for Monday and Friday campaigns. Uses environment variables for URLs.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Manages the sending of transactional emails (booking confirmations).
  - **Changes**: Updated multiple times to use increasingly professional and branded HTML templates provided by the user, including logic to embed a logo and use a consistent color scheme.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Acts as a client-side database for service offerings, pricing, and descriptions displayed on the site.
  - **Changes**: Updated frequently to add/remove services, change descriptions, and add pricing information, including  and  fields to support the 30% off promotion.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The main form for users to book a service.
  - **Changes**: Modified to add a Promo Code input field and an Apply button. State and handler functions were added to validate the promo code against the backend and display success/error messages.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: The central hub for administrators to manage the business.
  - **Changes**: Significantly enhanced to include a tabbed interface for Bookings, Schedule, and a new Analytics tab. The  component was integrated. The logic was updated to handle an in-progress booking status and display statistics for all booking statuses.

- ****:
  - **Importance**: Manages admin authentication state.
  - **Changes**: The hardcoded admin password  was removed and replaced with a check against an environment variable  for improved security.

<pending_tasks>
- Create and deliver a comprehensive deployment checklist document as requested by the user. This document should outline all the fixes and configurations needed before the application is saved to GitHub and deployed.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The last request from the user was to retrieve the email app password and create a checklist of fixes needed for a GitHub deployment.

The AI engineer successfully fulfilled the first part of the request by reading the password from the  file.

**Output:** 

Immediately after, the engineer was beginning the second part of the request: creating the deployment checklist. The last action was to state the intent to create this document: Now let me create a comprehensive deployment checklist document:. The actual creation and presentation of this document is the immediate next step.
The project is in a fully functional state in the preview environment, incorporating all requested features like promo codes, automated email campaigns, security enhancements, and UI/branding updates. The final step before this summary request was preparing to consolidate all necessary deployment fixes into a user-friendly checklist.
</current_work>

<optional_next_step>
Create and present the comprehensive deployment checklist document that outlines all necessary fixes and configurations required before saving the project to GitHub, as explicitly requested by the user.
